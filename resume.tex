%\begin{itemize}

\item[]
\headerrow {\textbf{Flashsubs}} {Independent Project, Mar - April 2016}
\begin{itemize} \item[]
Created a software for management of media library (Movies/TV Series) which intelligently fetches subtitles and renames obfuscated media files. It uses file hash to identify media in online database and uses filename for identification as last resort. It automatically downloads metadata like IMDb rating, plot, actors list etc. The link to project is \href{https://github.com/ozym4nd145/FlashSubs}{here}.
\end{itemize}

\headerrow {\textbf{\href{http://cap.rdv-iitd.com}{Rendezvous CAP Portal}}} {Independent Project, June - July 2017}
\begin{itemize} \item[]
Designed and developed the entire backend of Campus representative portal in NodeJS. Used Amazon DynamoDB for database and designed ingenious table structure to minimize the number of tables required. Implemented token based authentication along with OAuth Login and designed RESTful APIs for the entire competitive portal.
\end{itemize}


\item[]
\headerrow {\textbf{Multicycle ARM Processor}}{Prof. Anshul Kumar, Mar - April 2017}
\begin{itemize} \item[]
Developed a Multicycle ARM processor in VHDL on FPGA. Modelled memory as slave and used AHB Lite bus for connection. Implemented UART for memory and extended processor with 7 segment display and interrupt controller.
\end{itemize}

\item[]
\headerrow {\textbf{Prolog Interpreter}}{Prof. Sanjeeva Prasad, Mar - April 2017}
\begin{itemize} \item[] 
Designed a prolog interpreter written in OCaml. It used OCaml-lex for token generation and OCaml-yacc for parsing. Backtracking and rule unification were used to implement the relational backbone of the interpreter.
\end{itemize}

\item[]
\headerrow{ \textbf{Krivine and SECD Machine}} {Prof. Sanjeeva Prasad, April - May 2017}
\begin{itemize} \item[] 
Implemented a compiler with krivine and secd machine in Ocaml. A Lex Scanner converted program to tokens which were converted to an Abstract Syntax Tree using Recursive Descent Parser. The AST was type checked and a low level code was generated, which was executed by the machines. Machines also supported features like scoping,recursion etc.
\end{itemize}

\item[]
\headerrow { \textbf{AC Circuit Solver}} {Prof. Kolin Paul, Feb - Mar 2017}
\begin{itemize} \item[]
Designed and developed a AC Circuit solver in C which generates an SVG of input circuit and gives steady state solution of circuit. It used Lex and Yacc to parse netlist and Gaussian Elimination to solve node equations of circuit.
